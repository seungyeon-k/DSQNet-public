# DSQNet
The official repository for &lt;DSQNet: A Deformable Model-Based Supervised Learning Algorithm for Grasping Unknown Occluded Objects> (Seungyeon Kim<sup>\*</sup>, Taegyun Ahn<sup>\*</sup>, Yonghyeon Lee, Jihwan Kim, Michael Yu Wang, and Frank C. Park, T-ASE 2022).

> The paper proposes a recognition-based grasping method that merges a richer set of shape primitives, the deformable superquadrics, with a deep learning network, DSQNet, that is trained to identify complete object shapes from partial point cloud data.
